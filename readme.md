# ALL BASH SCRIPTS OPS CHALLENGES

***

# ops_challenge_class_02.sh
this script copies the /var/log/syslog file to a new file with a filename (in this case syslog) that includes the current date, and then it notifies the user in the terminal that the new file has been created.

# ops_challenge_class_03.sh
This script allows you to change permissions for all files in a specified directory while logging each action to a log file and displaying each file change one by one with a 1-second delay.

# ops_challenge_class_04.sh
This script provides a simple text-based menu system that allows the user to select options and view corresponding information or actions.

# ops_challenge_class_05.sh
This script makes a backup of the syslog and wtmp logfiles in zip format into a directory called backup and cleans the originals. (Must run as root.)
